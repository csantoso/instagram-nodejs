Simple Instagram API wrapper for Node.js
This API wrapper just exposes these endpoints' GET calls https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/ as regular JavaScript functions. Currently, this points to a default hook, defined in InstagramAPI.js that just prints the result to STDOUT; changing this is a find-and-replace task. Haven't touched pagnation yet.
